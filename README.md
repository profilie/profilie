# üîñ Introduction
Profilie is a static website generator that utilizes pre-built templates to create a simple, single-page social profile, portfolio, or personal website. The template includes JavaScript and CSS code to bring your site to life.

It operates entirely using JavaScript. All you need is a homepage (`index.html`) and a configuration file (`config.js`), and your social profile will be ready in minutes. Optionally, but recommended, you can also create a simple 404 page.

# üöÄ Getting Started
To begin your journey with Profilie, we've prepared a ready-to-use [**Starter Kit**](https://github.com/profilie/starter).

If your project is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, simply click the **Use this template** button at the top to create your own copy of the repository.

Once you've duplicated the template, navigate to config.js and customize it to suit your preferences.

You can also edit `index.html` to modify the site title, meta tags, and other elements to personalize your profile.
